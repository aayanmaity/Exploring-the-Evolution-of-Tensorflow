## Project 

Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git can be a real gold mine for software developers. They contain every change to the source code including the date (the "when"), the responsible developer (the "who"), as well as a little message that describes the intention (the "what") of a change.

In this notebook, we will analyze the evolution of `Tensorflow`.

Tensorflow is one of the widely used libraries for implementing Machine learning and Deep Learning algorithms involving large number of mathematical operations. Tensorflow was developed by Google and itâ€™s one of the most popular Machine Learning libraries on GitHub. Our dataset at hand contains the history of tensorflow development of 5 years (late 2015 - mid 2021). We get some insights into the work of the development efforts by -

* Identifying the TOP 10 contributors.
* Visualizing the commits over the years.

## Data Collection 

The dataset was created by using the command `git log --encoding=latin-1 --pretty="%at#%aN"` in May 2021. The `latin-1` encoded text output was saved in a header-less CSV file. In this file, each row is a commit entry with the following information:

* `timestamp`: the time of the commit as a UNIX timestamp in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (Git log placeholder `"%at"`)
* `author`: the name of the author that performed the commit (Git log placeholder `"%aN"`)

The columns are separated by the number sign `#`. 

The complete dataset is in the datasets/ directory. It is a csv file named `Tensorflowhistory.csv`.

## Tools used:

Code: Python Version: 3.7

For data wrangling and visualization: Pandas

## Tasks:

* Identifying the TOP 10 contributors.
* Visualizing the commits over the years.
